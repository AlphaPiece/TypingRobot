A robot called "tybot" that helps you practice typing.

This is a typing software for programmers. It will generate random printable ascii character strings, like
```
rNl+@g7f2e>(+c[=uJlY-=IONIPM;k!Nhc9zw!@/v#133|hI'W[{/0cu
```

After you finish typing this line, press enter; typbot will give you a summary about your practice.

Be aware that this is not a beginner-friendly typing software! 
It is designed for adept programmers or typists who want to master all-key typing.
### Enjoy!
